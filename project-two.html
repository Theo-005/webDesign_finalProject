				<h4 class="titleh4_OK font2_OKBold">Human Settlements</h4>
					<p class="p1_OK font1_OK"> The role of a city from a sustainability point of view is very important for social, human, commerce, culture, productivity and economic development. It is the backbone for society and has a knock-on affect in all areas. In the year 2008 for the first time in history the global urban population actually outnumbered the rural population. This marked an urban millennium and with that milestone it is forecasted that 2/3rds of the world population will be living in urban areas. With more than mankind living in urban areas (cities) and urban residency growing by up to 73 million per year it is calculated that urban areas account for about 70% of the world's gross doemstic product. Due to this high level of urbanization the UN has given importance to the topic of urban sustainability also known as their Sustainable Development Goals. This particular SDG is goal 11 which is Sustainable cities and human settlements. The goal of this SDG is to make cities and human settlements safe, resilient and sustainable. Another goal is to ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing in the world. Basic humantarian services and upgraded slums are a part of this too.</p>

				<h4 class="titleh4_OK font2_OKBold">Walkable Cities</h4>
			<!-- img https://www.pexels.com/photo/historic-nicholson-s-bridge-over-ripon-canal-34881658/  -->
				<img class="urban2_OK" src="images/urban8_OK.jpg" alt="urban" title="River">
					<p class="p2_OK font1_OK"> In the forefront of cities is its transport, how can a dense location move so many people without polluting the environment. This is where walkable cities makes it self known. This has a knock-on affect in manys ways such as reduced stress on natural resources, reduced emissions, improved air control, increased physical activity for urban residents, descreased rates of cardiovascular diseases and so on. Cities that promote walking are associated with healthier populations and it also contributes to lower rates of obesity and diabetes. As walking is considered a pain-free activity for most and it does not require recovery time nor special equipment for training. It is the most ideal in urban lifestyles or for those who cannot do heavy physical activities.
					<br><br>
					But what makes a city a walkable city? Ever since the 1970s oil crisis and the expansion of high-rise buildings did urban developers begin to priortise walkability in urban planning. In a simple termonlogy the walkability is defined by the quality of which the urban environment enables the mobility of pedestrians such as travelling by foot, this also includes those who use wheelchairs or other assitive devices. The quality of walkability is measured through different variables, pedestrian footpaths, accessibility to amenities and environmental conditions. The footpaths have to be accessible, direct, connected, safe, comfortable and well maintained for a wide spread of different pedrestrians. In addition the footpaths must allow pedestrians to reach points of public transport safely and effectively. In terms of amenities schools, shops, restaurants, offices, parks and gyms are required to encourage people to go to for their daily activities. Acitivty in these locations should be robust enough to generate income for a high quality of life. The housing must be affordable for those who live there, foods and servcies should be interrupted and accessible such as markets. Basic services like water, electricty, sewage and communciations should be well established. Successful walkable cities contribute to reducing automobile transportation and urban centers with higher population densities and walkable communnities tend to have lower carbon emissions. The drop in emissions can also be due to the absence of agricultural and industrial activities. But the main drop is credited to less cars and shorter transporation commutes.
					<br><br>
					Greenness and parks are a major component for walkable cities. having aesthetically pleasing vegetation and native trees to reduce tempertaures and cast natural shadows, they also improve air quality. The mental relief of walking through some greenery is not to be underestimated for the average urban dweller. The knock on affect of cleaner air and greenery promotes more outdoor activity from those living in cities.

				<h4 class="titleh4_OK font2_OKBold">Summary</h4>
					<p class="p3_OK font1_OK">The ultimate goal is spreading awareness and to hopefully have every major and minor city to be sustainable and walkable. Every person given an adequate home and access to amenities while reducing pollution. Eradicating poverty and hunger. The UN is set to accomplish these goals before 2030 and will work tireless to acheive them. The mental benefit cannot be taken for granted when urban sustainablity is implemented properly. People are happier, have homes and access to clean water. The positive effects of having access to parks and promoting people to be more active has been linked to lower rates of obesity and cardiovascular issues to those in sustainable cities. The main benefit of this is not only the health benefits but the lower emissions either directly by less agriculture is the urban environment and the direct absence of less cars.</p>
