					<h3 class="ls_p title">Affordable Housing</h3>
				    <p class="ls_p">To understand affordable housing, we looked at global data showing that between 1.6 and 3 billion people struggle with housing problems such as high rent, overcrowding or lack of basic services. Many cities are growing so quickly that they can’t keep up with the need for safe, affordable places to live. We found that in some regions, especially sub-Saharan Africa, people spend a much larger share of their income on housing compared to places like Europe or North America. This research helped us see how rising costs and limited housing options make life harder for families, and why cities need better planning and stronger policies to ensure everyone has access to a safe, stable and affordable home.</p>

					<h3 class="ls_p title">Human Settlements and Walkable Cities</h3>
				    <p class="ls_p">To understand human settlements, we explored how towns and cities grow and what people need to live safely and comfortably, especially as populations rise and issues like overcrowding, high housing costs and damaged infrastructure become more common. We also examined how walkability fits into strong, well-planned communities, learning that many cities lack safe sidewalks and pedestrian-friendly streets, which pushes people to rely on cars and increases pollution. By studying reports, we saw that investing in good housing, reliable services and safer, well-connected walking routes helps create healthier, more resilient and more enjoyable places where people can live, work and move around easily.</p>

					<h3 class="ls_p title">Reduced Environmental Impact</h3>
				    <p class="ls_p">When researching ways to reduce carbon emissions, we looked closely at how transportation in cities — especially cars and buses — plays a major role in producing pollution. As cities grow, more people rely on private cars to get around, which leads to heavier traffic, higher fuel use and more carbon released into the air. We studied information showing that many cities lack strong public transport systems, so buses are often overcrowded or unreliable, causing even more people to turn to cars. We also explored how better planning, such as improving bus networks, adding cleaner vehicle options and designing cities where people can live closer to work and school, can reduce the need for long car trips. This research helped us understand how improving everyday transportation choices can make a big difference in lowering carbon emissions and creating healthier urban environments</p>

					<h3 class="ls_p title">Heritage Protection</h3>
				    <p class="ls_p">For heritage protection, we researched how countries fund the care of important cultural and historical places, such as monuments, museums and natural sites. We found that while some countries invest a lot of money to protect these places, others struggle to provide even basic funding. This creates big differences in how well heritage sites are maintained and whether they can survive future challenges like urban development or natural disasters. By studying the data, we learned that protecting heritage is not just about preserving old buildings — it’s also about keeping cultural identity alive for future generations. This helped us understand why cities need to include heritage protection in their planning and provide enough resources to safeguard these irreplaceable sites.</p>
